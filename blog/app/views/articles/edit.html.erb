<h1>Edit Article</h1>

<%= render "form", article: @article %>

<!--
since Create and Update will use the same forms, 
form layout has been extracted to something called "partial"

A partial's filename must be prefixed with an underscore, e.g. _form.html.erb. 
But when rendering, it is referenced without the underscore, e.g. render "form".s
